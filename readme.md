# alex-docs

**What's this??**

This repo contains up-to-date docs (as of March 2021) to the [alex](https://github.com/simonmar/alex) haskell lexer generator.
The documentation can be seen at [monlih.github.io/alex-docs/](https://monlih.github.io/alex-docs/).

**Why??**

Because the ["official" docs](https://www.haskell.org/alex/doc/html/index.html) are out of date (and let's be honest, ugly!)
